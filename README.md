# Blood Cod Plugins
![Build plugin](https://github.com/Ewpratten/blood_cod_plugins/workflows/Build%20plugin/badge.svg) 

The *Blood Cod Plugins* pack is a monolithic server-side Minecraft plugin for use on a private survival multiplayer server. The goal of this plugin is to integrate the server history and lore into gameplay by providing custom NBT-backed items, crafting recipes, and advancements. Due to the one-off nature of this plugin, you'll find many hard-coded UUIDs and world coordinates in the plugin code.
