# Blood Cod Plugins
![Build plugin](https://github.com/Ewpratten/blood_cod_plugins/workflows/Build%20plugin/badge.svg) 

The *Blood Cod Plugins* pack is a monolithic server-side Minecraft plugin for use on a private survival multiplayer server. The goal of this plugin is to integrate the server history and lore into gameplay by providing custom NBT-backed items, crafting recipes, and advancements. Due to the one-off nature of this plugin, you'll find many hard-coded UUIDs and world coordinates in the plugin code.

## Features

### Smite

Players with the `god` or `godlike` [permission]() have the ability to smite any player with their fist at any time. When smiting a player, the smiter is gifted a fast and strong regeneration effect, and both players are gifted 14 seconds of fire resistance. This prevents the smiter from accidentally killing another player when only meaning to strike them with lightning for comedic effect.

When a player has been smote (smitten?), they are awarded the `Enlightenment` advancement. Any player that has been killed by a `god` or `godlike` player in this process will also get the `Ultimate Sacrifice` advancement.
